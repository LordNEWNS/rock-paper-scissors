# rock-paper-scissors

This project is one that i have been working on to help me learn how to use javascript to make a webpage more interactive. i have had a lot of with this one so far and it has tough me so so much. 

i wanted to go a little further than the assignments paramaters of only having the game go to a static number of win. so i took it uppon myself to impliment an imput that allows you to enter the number of rounds won required for a game won.
